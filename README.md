## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) - Mobile-friendly interactive maps
- [IPify API](https://geo.ipify.org/) - IP Geolocation API


### Setup and Usage

1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  **API Key Configuration**:
    - This project uses the IPify API.
    - Open `script.js` and locate the `apiKey` variable.
    - Replace the value with your own API key if the current one is invalid.
3.  **Running the App**:
    - Open `index.html` in your browser.
    - **Note**: For the best experience and to avoid CORS issues with some browsers, it is recommended to use a local development server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code or `python3 -m http.server`).
